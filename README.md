Hi there, this is a simple program I created for my dad who is also a gemstone cutter. He sometimes forget the full names of gemstones and wants to find refractive index or poilshing materials in a very fast way. This is the solution I've find for my dad. Program uses Levenshtein distance algorithm in order to match our input with the gemstone names. Then shows us the refractive index (RI) and Double Refraction and correct combination of buffing wheel and polishing compound of this gemstone by reading an excel table Gem-List.xls 
</body>
btw I've manipulated the gemstone names with Regex to fit in my python script.

<strong> If it is your first time using a Python code, first of all you should install Python to your computer. You don't have to install an IDE like PyCharm, just install Python interpreter from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
 </strong>

### Install Python dependencies
Run the following line in the project folder with terminal: 

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Run

`python guide.py`

### Run with .bat file
If you want to start the program just by clicking, you should create a batch file. Just write the below code in notepad and save as text.bat different than text.txt

Don't forget to change the text for correct directory.

When you create the batch (.bat) file, create a shortcut from it to desktop or wherever you want and run program from there.

`"Directory you've installed python" "Directory of the guide.py you downloaded from here"
pause`

`"C:\Program Files\Python38\python.exe" "C:\Users\user\Desktop\gemstone-cutter-guide\.venv\guide.py"
pause`
